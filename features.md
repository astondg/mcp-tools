# Freelancer API Integration Features

## Project Overview
Building an MCP tool that integrates with the Freelancer.com API to retrieve project listings for AI agent analysis. The goal is to help users identify projects that match their skills and are financially viable.

## Research Summary
- Freelancer API uses OAuth2 authentication with custom header format: `freelancer-oauth-v1: <oauth_access_token>`
- Official Python SDK available (`freelancersdk`)
- API requires developer account approval process
- Current API version: 0.1

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ… (In Progress)
- [x] Remove placeholder MCP tools
- [ ] Set up basic project structure for Freelancer integration
- [ ] Create environment variable configuration for API credentials

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
- [ ] Create basic project search functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Test with sample API calls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Search Features
- [ ] Add project filtering (budget, category, skills)
- [ ] Implement project details retrieval
- [ ] Add pagination support
- [ ] Create structured response formatting

### Phase 4: AI Analysis Features
- [ ] Add project evaluation criteria
- [ ] Implement budget vs effort analysis
- [ ] Create skill matching functionality
- [ ] Add project viability scoring

### Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation Setup
- **Next Steps**: Remove placeholder tools and set up API structure
- **Blockers**: Need to obtain Freelancer API credentials for testing

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js API routes with MCP adapter
- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Environment variables for sensitive API credentials
- Consider implementing API response caching for performance
