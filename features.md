# Freelancer API Integration Features

## Project Overview
Building an MCP tool that integrates with the Freelancer.com API to retrieve project listings for AI agent analysis. The goal is to help users identify projects that match their skills and are financially viable.

## Research Summary
- Freelancer API uses OAuth2 authentication with custom header format: `freelancer-oauth-v1: <oauth_access_token>`
- Official Python SDK available (`freelancersdk`)
- API requires developer account approval process
- Current API version: 0.1

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Remove placeholder MCP tools
- [x] Set up basic project structure for Freelancer integration
- [x] Create mock implementation with proper Zod validation
- [x] Update homepage to reflect new tool
- [x] Verify build passes with new implementation

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration

#### Phase 2A: Authentication Infrastructure ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Set up Upstash Redis for token storage
- [x] Create authentication page UI (/auth)
- [x] Implement OAuth callback handler
- [x] Add authentication status API endpoints
- [x] Update MCP tool to check for stored tokens
- [x] Add authentication notice to homepage

#### Phase 2B: Real API Integration (Pending)
- [ ] Register application with Freelancer for OAuth credentials
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production
- [ ] Implement real Freelancer API project search
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Test with live API calls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Search Features
- [ ] Add project filtering (budget, category, skills)
- [ ] Implement project details retrieval
- [ ] Add pagination support
- [ ] Create structured response formatting

### Phase 4: AI Analysis Features
- [ ] Add project evaluation criteria
- [ ] Implement budget vs effort analysis
- [ ] Create skill matching functionality
- [ ] Add project viability scoring

### Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 2B - Real API Integration
- **Completed**: Phase 1 Foundation + Phase 2A Authentication Infrastructure
- **Next Steps**: Register with Freelancer for OAuth credentials, implement real API calls
- **Blockers**: Need to apply for Freelancer developer account and API access
- **Ready to Deploy**: Complete authentication flow with Redis token storage

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js API routes with MCP adapter
- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Environment variables for sensitive API credentials
- Consider implementing API response caching for performance
