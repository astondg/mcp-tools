# Freelancer API Integration Features

## Project Overview
Building an MCP tool that integrates with the Freelancer.com API to retrieve project listings for AI agent analysis. The goal is to help users identify projects that match their skills and are financially viable.

## Research Summary
- Freelancer API uses OAuth2 authentication with custom header format: `freelancer-oauth-v1: <oauth_access_token>`
- Official Python SDK available (`freelancersdk`)
- API requires developer account approval process
- Current API version: 0.1

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ… (Completed)
- [x] Remove placeholder MCP tools
- [x] Set up basic project structure for Freelancer integration
- [x] Create mock implementation with proper Zod validation
- [x] Update homepage to reflect new tool
- [x] Verify build passes with new implementation

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration
- [ ] Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
- [ ] Create basic project search functionality
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Test with sample API calls

### Phase 3: Enhanced Search Features
- [ ] Add project filtering (budget, category, skills)
- [ ] Implement project details retrieval
- [ ] Add pagination support
- [ ] Create structured response formatting

### Phase 4: AI Analysis Features
- [ ] Add project evaluation criteria
- [ ] Implement budget vs effort analysis
- [ ] Create skill matching functionality
- [ ] Add project viability scoring

### Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 2 - Basic API Integration
- **Next Steps**: Obtain Freelancer API credentials and implement real authentication
- **Blockers**: Need to apply for Freelancer developer account and API access
- **Latest Commit**: Foundation setup with mock implementation deployed

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js API routes with MCP adapter
- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Environment variables for sensitive API credentials
- Consider implementing API response caching for performance
