# Freelancer API Integration Features

## Project Overview
Building an MCP tool that integrates with the Freelancer.com API to retrieve project listings for AI agent analysis. The goal is to help users identify projects that match their skills and are financially viable.

## Research Summary
- Freelancer API uses OAuth2 authentication with custom header format: `freelancer-oauth-v1: <oauth_access_token>`
- Official Python SDK available (`freelancersdk`)
- API requires developer account approval process
- Current API version: 0.1

## MVP Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Remove placeholder MCP tools
- [x] Set up basic project structure for Freelancer integration
- [x] Create mock implementation with proper Zod validation
- [x] Update homepage to reflect new tool
- [x] Verify build passes with new implementation

### Phase 2: Basic API Integration

#### Phase 2A: Authentication Infrastructure ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Set up Upstash Redis for token storage
- [x] Create authentication page UI (/auth)
- [x] Implement OAuth callback handler
- [x] Add authentication status API endpoints
- [x] Update MCP tool to check for stored tokens
- [x] Add authentication notice to homepage

#### Phase 2B: Real API Integration ✅ (Completed)
- [x] Register application with Freelancer for OAuth credentials
- [x] Configure environment variables and OAuth flow
- [x] Implement real Freelancer API project search
- [x] Add proper TypeScript types and error handling
- [x] Support both OAuth flow and test token override
- [x] Ready for live testing with FREELANCER_TEST_TOKEN

### Phase 3: Project Bidding Functionality

#### Phase 3A: Enhanced Search Features ✅ (In Progress)
- [x] Update to use active projects endpoint (/projects/active)
- [ ] Add project filtering (budget, category, skills)  
- [ ] Implement project details retrieval
- [ ] Add pagination support
- [ ] Create structured response formatting

#### Phase 3B: Bidding Implementation (Planned)
- [ ] Research Freelancer bidding API endpoint and parameters
- [ ] Create `place_bid` MCP tool with proper validation
- [ ] Implement bid parameters (amount, period, description, milestones)
- [ ] Add bid status checking and management
- [ ] Handle bidding errors and restrictions
- [ ] Add bid history and tracking features

#### Phase 3C: Advanced Bidding Features (Future)
- [ ] AI-powered bid amount suggestions based on project complexity
- [ ] Automated bid templates and personalization
- [ ] Bid success rate tracking and analytics
- [ ] Project evaluation scoring before bidding
- [ ] Bulk bidding capabilities with filters

### Phase 4: AI Analysis Features
- [ ] Add project evaluation criteria
- [ ] Implement budget vs effort analysis
- [ ] Create skill matching functionality
- [ ] Add project viability scoring

### Phase 5: Production Ready
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Rate limiting and caching
- [ ] Logging and monitoring
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 3A - Enhanced Search + Phase 3B - Bidding Implementation
- **Completed**: Phase 1 Foundation + Phase 2A Authentication + Phase 2B Real API Integration
- **Recent**: Updated to use /projects/active endpoint for better project search results
- **Next Steps**: Implement bidding functionality, enhance search capabilities, add AI analysis
- **Blockers**: Need Freelancer bidding API documentation from user
- **Ready to Deploy**: Working project search with OAuth and test token support

## Technical Notes
- Using Next.js API routes with MCP adapter
- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Environment variables for sensitive API credentials
- Consider implementing API response caching for performance
